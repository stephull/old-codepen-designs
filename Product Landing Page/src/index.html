        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>Our biggest goal has been implementing a solar farm in Mexico. It is one of the largest solar farms in North America. </p>

        <figcaption>Solar farm near Tijuana</figcaption>
        <p>Our commitments have led to a 7000% increase in solar power energy across Baja California and Northern Mexico regions of Mexico. We've also increased projects for renewable energy with solar panel projects in Arizona, and a 1000% increase in renewable energy via wind turbine installations in the Eastern U.S.</p>
        <p>We were recognized as being one of the <b>Top Ten Best Companies for Renewable Energy</b> according to the <b>Renewable Energy Magazine</b> in 2015, and again in 2017, both coming in only after Cascadia Power. <strong><br>We are honored that our commitments have impacted the world for the better!</strong></p>
